There's been massive innovation in the database and backend space for developers building applications with serverless and edge compute. There are new tools, companies, and even programming models that simplify how developers store data.

This post will be an overview of databases that pair well with modern application and compute providers.

## Criteria

I'll focus on **transactional¹** workloads instead of analytical² workloads.

The “backend” space is vast: search, analytics, data science, and more – so I'll niche down here. The primary criteria of this overview is:

1. Services that work exceptionally well when paired with serverless and edge compute
2. Services that work with JavaScript and TypeScript codebases

> **Disclaimer:** I work at Vercel, which partners with companies in this post. I also have personally used many of these tools for my own personal projects. My site currently uses PlanetScale and I'm also an angel investor in Supabase (mentioned below).

## A new programming model

Relational databases have been around for 25+ years.
